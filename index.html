          <li>Here are features in JavaScript that are common to all coding languages. Master these fundamentals: </li>
          <br>
          <ol>
            <li>Variables - Containers that store values.</li>
            <li>Comments - Snippets of text that can be added along with code.</li>
            <li>Operators - Mathematical symbol that produces a result based on two values or variables. </li>
            <li>Conditionals - Code structures used to test if an expression returns true or not.</li>
            <li>Functions - A way of packaging functionality that you wish to reuse.</li>
            <li>Events - Real interactivity on a website requires event handlers. These are code structures that listen for activity in the browser, and run code in response. The most obvious example is handling the click event, which is fired by the browser when you click on something with your mouse. </li>
          </ol>
          <br>
          <li>Primitive Values:</li>
          <li>Null, Undefined, Boolean, Number, Big Int, String, Symbol.</li>
          <br>
          <li>Symbols can be used as a key part of an object property.
            <li>Objects - A value in memory which is possibly referenced by an identifier. In JavaScript they are only mutable values. Functions are in fact, also objects with the additional capability of being callable.</li>
            <li>Properties - In JavaScript objects can be seen as a collection of properties.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Control Flow - The order in which a computer executes code in a script which is always top to bottom.</li>
